## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r Downloading and reading dataset, echo=TRUE}
dataurl <- 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'

#Download Data
if(!file.exists("activity.csv")){
        download.file(dataurl, destfile = 'repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip', 
                      mode = "wb")
        unzip(zipfile = 'repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip')
}

#Read Data
outcomes <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", na.strings = "NA")

#First data of dataset
head(outcomes)
#Last data of dataset
tail(outcomes)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r Mean steps per day}
#Histogram
Mean_steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps~date, outcomes, sum)
hist(Mean_steps_per_day$steps, main = 'Frequency of steps per day', 
     xlab = 'Steps', col = "lightsteelblue", ylim = c(0,15), 
     breaks =seq(0,25000, by=1000))

#Mean
mean(Mean_steps_per_day$steps)
#Median
median(Mean_steps_per_day$steps)
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r Average daily activity pattern}
Average_steps <- aggregate(steps~interval, outcomes, mean)
plot(Average_steps$interval, Average_steps$steps, type = 'l', 
     main = 'Daily activity', xlab = 'Interval (5 min each one)', 
     ylab = 'Average number of steps', col = "lightsteelblue", lwd = 3 )

#Interval that, on average, contains maximum number of steps
Average_steps$interval[which.max((Average_steps$steps))]

```

## Imputing missing values

```{r Missing values}
#Total number of NA values in the dataset
sum(is.na(outcomes$steps))

# Mean of NA values in the dataset
Percent_of_NA <- (mean(is.na(outcomes$steps)))*100
Percent_of_NA #The percent of NA values is high

#Cleaning the data set 
clean_outcomes <- na.omit(outcomes)

#First data of the clean dataset
head(clean_outcomes)

#Last data of the clean dataset
tail(clean_outcomes)

#Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are 
#imputed

Clean_mean_steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps~date, clean_outcomes, sum)
hist(Clean_mean_steps_per_day$steps, main = 'Frequency of steps per day', 
     xlab = 'Steps', col = "lightsteelblue", ylim = c(0,15), 
     breaks = seq(0,25000, by=1000))
#Mean
mean(Clean_mean_steps_per_day$steps)
#Median
median(Clean_mean_steps_per_day$steps)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r Difference of activity between weekdays and weekends}


```
